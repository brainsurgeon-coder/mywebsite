<strong>Right Brain versus Left Brain </strong> <br>
    For many centuries, it is thought that the left brained are more analytical while right brained are more creative. Therefore people are either left dominant or right dominant. <br><br>

    Take this test <a href = "https://braintest.sommer-sommer.com/en/"><strong>HERE</strong></a> to see how much are you left brained versus right brained(external link). Its fun. Compare with your friends.  Don’t forget to come back again and read the portion below. It gets more intriguing!!! <a href = "https://braintest.sommer-sommer.com/en/"><strong>Lets BEGIN!!</strong></a><br><br>

In neurosciences, the word left and right indicates dominance of one half of the brain over other. The parameter that is chosen to define dominance of one half of the brain is dependent on the function it subserves. To understand this in a very simple way, language comprehension and generation is the modality that is  equated with dominance in most.  Memory, also is implicated in ascribing dominance. For example verbal memory (ability to recall words and sentences spoken) is located in the dominant hemisphere. In large majority, the left part of the brain is dominant. Dominant for language and some forms of memory. However, it doesn’t mean that the rest of the brain is not participating. In fact, few studies show that there is no  strict demarcation of language area in the brain. In fact, it is the dense neural connectivity within the brain, that subserves these functions. Hence dominance may not be "location" specific but "network" oriented. Personality traits that makes “you” is not located in one half but rather it is due to the presence of many areas in both halves, interspersed and densely connected with millions of nerve fibres. Therefore, it is unlikely that logic of Dr Jekyll and and creativity of Mr Hyde are located  discretely in each half of the brain. <br>

<strong>The Gigantic supercomputer - 3 millon hours of TV shows - 300 years of show time!!!! </strong> <br>
    The human brain has about one billion neurons(cells). More than 1,000 connections exist between each neurons, leading to a trillion superconduting junctions. These neurons orchestrate and coordinate their activites so that each one helps with several functions such as memories, at a time,. This humungously increases the brain’s storage capacity to something closer to around 2.5 petabytes (or a million gigabytes). For comparison, if your brain worked like a digital video recorder in a television, 2.5 petabytes would be enough to hold three million hours of TV shows. You would have to leave the TV running continuously for more than 300 years to use up all that storage!!!
    The human brain is responsible for keeping your body running all day long. It not only helps people think and learn new things, but it also controls your movement and speech, too. The brain is part of the central nervous system and receives tons of information. Some more fascinating facts to follow. <br>

<strong>Ouchhhhh...Pain??? Brain can't feel it! </strong><br>
We operate on Brain sometimes keeping patient awake!! The brain has layers of coverings and blood vessels that contain pain receptors, the brain itself has zero. When a person has a headache, for example, it's often thought of as pain stemming from the brain, but this is actually not the case. The muscles and skin surrounding the brain, however, can feel pain.<br>

<strong>Our brain is super hungry! </strong><br>
Your brain might account for only about 3 percent of your body weight, but it receives about 30 percent of the blood being pumped by your heart. It takes the brain about 1/10,000th of a second to respond to something and generate an action.<br>

<strong>Almost half of a child's energy goes to fuel his or her brain</strong><br>
    
In order for the brain to stay running at top-notch, it requires significant amounts of energy. And this is even more true for young children who are still learning, processing, and developing at a fast rate. Scientists at Northwestern University discovered recently that in the preschool years, when a child's brain development is faster, physical growth is slower, possibly to save more energy for the developing brain. Conversely, during puberty, when physical growth is faster, brain development is slower — which may come as no surprise to parents of teenagers!<br>

  <h3>10 Things you didn't know about your spine</h3>

1. The bones in your spine serve two important functions.
The adult spine consists of 26 bones: 24 vertebrae, the sacrum (near the bottom) and coccyx (at the end).

The bones provide a column of support, bearing the weight of the head, neck and trunk and allowing us to maintain an upright position, whether standing or sitting.

Your spine is upright but surprisingly not straight. There are in fact four curves to the spine to prevent us from toppling forward.

Pregnancy can distort the lower curve, leading to back pain.<br>

 

2. The bones also protect the spinal cord
 The fibres ascending the spinal cord carry sensory information to the brain from skin, joints and muscles; the descending fibres carry instructions to move the muscles.

The human body has about 10 million sensory neurones and half a million motor neurones.

Other fibres in the spinal cord form the autonomic nervous system, controlling functions such as heart rate and digestion.<br>

 
3. A lot can go wrong with the spine

It can bend the wrong way, such as in scoliosis, kyphosis or lordosis, it can be severed in spinal cord injury, the nerves can lose their covering in multiple sclerosis, tumours can compress the nerves and infection and abscesses can form.<br>

 

4. The cervical (neck) spine allows amazing movement of the head
“Your head is relatively massive. It sits atop the spinal vertebrae like a soup bowl on the tip of a finger”!
Connections between the top vertebra and the skull allow us to nod and look upward and downward. Connections between the top and second vertebrae allow us to move our head from side to side: a clever piece of engineering indeed.<br>

 

5. A cross section of the spinal cord shows a grey butterfly structure on a white background
The central grey part consists of the cell bodies of the nerves: the control centres where the DNA is stored.


The surrounding white part contains the fine branches of the nerve cell that can stretch from the brain to your fingertips. Nerve cells are the longest cells in your body and many are up to a metre in length.<br>

 
6. You don’t have a tail
The bottom bone of the spine (the coccyx) is sometimes called the tailbone. It’s not a tail, but instead an important anchoring point for many ligaments and muscles of the pelvis.

If you fall and damage the coccyx, it’s hard to walk. The name coccyx is derived from cuckoo as the bone is shaped like a cuckoo’s beak.<br>

 

7. Your spine is in constant communication with the brain
This is most clearly demonstrated when the connection is lost in spinal cord injury.

Christopher Reeves suffered a cut across his spinal cord below the first vertebra, losing all sensation and movement below the neck.<br>

 

8. You are taller in the morning… and in space
A lack of gravity pulling the vertebrae close together means that astronauts can grow 5cm taller in space and you are 1cm taller in the morning.

NASA is studying further effects of microgravity on the length of the spine.<br>

 

9. What’s a spinal tap?
In this case, nothing to do with rock music. Your spinal cord is surrounded by clear fluid to cushion it from injury.

Withdrawal of this fluid using a needle is called a spinal tap or lumbar puncture. It can help diagnose infection and treat headaches.<br>

 

10. The spine in art and mythology
The vertebra at the top of the spine is called Atlas. It is named after Atlas who, in Greek mythology, holds the world on his shoulders: just as this bone holds the head up high.

A hidden image of the spinal cord is thought to have been depicted by Michelangelo, in his painting on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel in Rome.<br>
