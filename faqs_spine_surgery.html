        <h3><strong>
            # Why surgery is needed?
            </strong></h3>
        <p>Surgery of spine is required only and only when non surgical methods like rest, medications, physiotherapy fail and patient continues to have severe pain, weakness, paralysis or progressive bending or slippage. Sometimes it is done without waiting if there something called as "cauda equina syndrome". </p>
        <hr>
        <h3><strong># What are the options?</strong></h3>
        <p>When there are no "red flags" as assessed by a spine surgeon then options like painkillers, pain injections, accupressure, accupuncture etc are there </p><hr>
        
            <h3><strong># What is the risk with Spine surgery?</strong>
            </h3>
        <p>Spine surgery if selected carefully and performed by an experienced as well as skilled surgeon, possesses, very minimal risks. At our centre, the risks are  even minimised due to the adoption of keyhole minimally invasive approach(endoscopic/microscopic).  </p>
          <hr>
            <h3><strong># Will I get paralysed? Or Bed ridded?</strong></h3><p>When the indications are clear cut, reasonable treatment goals are set preoperatively, skill set and technology is used efficiently/effectively and patient related factors are favorable, then, the chances of having such a catastrophic complications are extremely small. On the otherhand, not undergoing surgery or delaying it further, MAY end up, having,  same complications that are being scrutinized and afraid of! </p>
           <hr>
             <h3><strong># Who is better Neurosurgeon or Ortho/spine Surgeon?</strong></h3>
            <p>Both are trained in doing surgeries of the spine. However, spinal cord problems are better handled by Neurosurgeons, while, complex large bony curvature deformities/bony tumors are dealt better by ortho spine surgeons. However, more than 90 percent of cases with spine issues can be operated by both with good results. </p>
            <hr>
            <h3><strong># Will it be done by Laser or keyhole?</strong></h3>
            <p> Laser technology is not popular in Spine sugery unlike plastic surgery, ENT surgery etc. There are better tools such as O arm, minimally invasive surgery that has the potential to make Spine surgery a Day Care Procedure(In selected cases)</p>
              <hr>
            <h3><strong># Whether screws, rods, fusion surgery is required?</strong></h3>
            <p>This is determined by the type of symptoms, patient factors and pre surgical evaluation. Large majority of patients do not require additonal screws etc</p>
              <hr>
            <h3><strong># If used which implants are better - Indian or Imported?</strong></h3>
            <p>Indian implants are more price friendly. No long term data exists comparing foreign and indian implants in rigorous clinical trials providing Class 1 evidence. However it is my experience that till the native bone is fused, both are equally efficacious.</p>
              <hr>
            
            
            <h3><strong># What is the cost?</strong></h3>
            <p>Surgical cost of basic spine surgery (without implants) in a general ward is approximately 2.0 Lakhs INR and it increases depending on the facilities and bed status chosen and complexity of surgery. The cost may be lower for certain procedures such as vertebroplasty etc. There is no package deal and most of the insurance companies cover spine surgeries.Do mail at hrishikesh.sarkar@hotmail.com  or Whatsapp on +919821600245 (Secretary). </p>
            <hr>
            <h3><strong># How many days in the hospital</strong></h3>
            <p> From the day of surgery, for an uncomplicated case, you may need to stay for about 5-7 days. Some cases have been discharged the next day too. Every attempt is made to minimize the no of days in the hospital. </p>
            <hr>
            <h3><strong># When can I resume work normally?</strong></h3>
        <p> There is a period of about month following surgery during restriction of activites limited to house are required. Followed by that, progressively level of activity is increased, so as to goal of normalizing activites by three months is achieved. However it will depend on pain threshold, type of activities, healing and strenth(mind and body) of the patient. Physiotherapists and rehablitation experts play significant role in this phase. </p>
        <hr>
            <h3><strong># What are general dos and dont's following surgery?</strong></h3>
        <p> <strong>Do's</strong></p>
