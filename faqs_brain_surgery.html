        <h3><strong>
            # Why surgery is needed?
            </strong></h3>
        <p>Brain surgery is required for any of the following reasons (list not limited)- reduce the pressure inside the skull, get the diagnosis, prevent regrowth of tumors, facilitate further therapy and recovery, improve pain/disability/fits/convulsions/seizures etc. When a surgeon is ascertained there are no better options available, surgery is recommended, some times as an emergency or other times as semiurgent and/or planned way. </p>
        <hr>
        <h3><strong># What are the options?</strong></h3>
        <p>Occasionally there are options such as waitful watch, Stereotactic radiosurgery/Gamma Knife surgery/Proton beam therapy, Laser interstitial thermal therapy(LITT), however, the Neurosurgeon is  the best person who can decide which is a better option. </p><hr>
        
            <h3><strong># What is the risk with brain surgery?</strong>
            </h3>
        <p>Every surgery carries some risk. However, it depends on many factors such as type of surgery, location of tumor, grade of the tumor, extent of the tumor, patients age - associated conditions such as Heart/Kidney/Lung ailments, experience and skill of the surgeon and the team, tools/gadgets available etc. At our centre, the risks are minimised to as low as possible, due to the well established skill set of the surgeon and his team (Dedicated Neuroanaesthetists,Neurophysiologist, Neuointensivists, Neuroradiologists, Interventional Neuroradiologist, Neurorehabilitation) along with availability of latest world class technology. Every attempt is made to adopt minimally invasive key hole approach. </p>
          <hr>
            <h3><strong># Will I get paralysed? Or Bed ridded? Comatose? Can I die?</strong></h3><p>When the indications are clear cut, reasonable treatment goals are set preoperatively, skill set and technology is used efficiently/effectively and patient related factors are favorable, then, the chances of having such a catastrophic complications are extremely small. On the otherhand, not undergoing surgery or delaying it further, MAY end up, having,  same complications that are being scrutinized and afraid of! </p>
           <hr>
            <h3><strong># What is the cost?</strong></h3>
            <p>Surgical cost of basic brain tumor surgery in a general ward is approximately 2.0 Lakhs INR and it increases depending on the facilities and bed status chosen and complexity of surgery. The cost may be lower for certain procedures such as VP shunts etc. Except of Stereotactic radiosurgery, (Gamma knife equivalent) there is no package deal and most of insurance companies are cover brain tumor surgeries.Do mail at hrishikesh.sarkar@hotmail.com  or Whatsapp on +919821600245 (Secretary). </p>
